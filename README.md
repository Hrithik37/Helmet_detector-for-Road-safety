# Helmet_detector-for-Road-safety using Open CV and Convolutional Neural Netwroks
It is a model where it detects if the rider is wearing helmet or not
If the person is not wearning helmet then it triggers the model and starts beeping or alarming until person wears helmet, same as in cars if the driver does not wear seat belt then we get beep sound until we wear it.
This implementation solves the problem of rider not willing to wear helmet and makes compulsory to wear while riding bike.
