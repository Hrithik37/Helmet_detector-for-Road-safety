# Helmet_detector-for-Road-safety using Open CV and Convolutional Neural Netwroks
It is a model where we need to deploy it in a raspberry pi or arduino
This device/camera is placed around the corner of bike sppedo meter and when bike starts, it will automatically detects if the rider is wearing helmet or not
If the person is not wearning helmet then it triggers the device and starts beeping until person wears helmet same as in cars if the driver does not wear seat belt then we get beep sound until we wear it.
This implementation solves the problem of person not willing to wear helmet and makes compulsory to wear.
